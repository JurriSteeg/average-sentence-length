# The difference between the average sentence in the English language and the Dutch language

This repository includes the pyhton code which counts the length of all the books and calculates the averages. The books that are used in the code are also available in this repository in .txt formats.

## The Pyhthon Code
### Running

When you run the code, there is no need for implementing the books in the command line. Therefore the commandline will look like this:
```
python3 book_counter.py
```
They are coded into the python code, but are still changeble by replacing them in one line of the code.

### Results

The result of the code has been formulated to make very clear what the output number means. If you change the book that is used to run the code, it will not change in the output.
